# DisktroByte

DisktroByte is a lightweight, high-performance, enterprise-ready P2P distributed file system. It is designed for organizational use, enabling secure, fast, and decentralized file sharing without the complexity of blockchain technology.

## Features

-   **Peer Discovery and Registration:** Uses HTTP-based endpoints (`/ping`, `/peers`) for peer discovery and registration.
-   **Liveness Check:** Actively monitors peers to ensure they are online.
-   **Compression:** Includes a compression module with media-type detection to skip non-beneficial file types (e.g., `.mp4`, `.jpg`, `.zip`).
-   **File Chunking:** Splits files into smaller, transportable chunks.
-   **Encryption:** Secures file chunks using ChaCha20-Poly1305.
-   **Pluggable Storage:** Supports different storage backends, with a local filesystem implementation provided.
-   **File Transfer:** A client-server model for transferring files between peers.
-   **CLI Interface:** A command-line interface for interacting with the application.
-   **Web GUI:** A modern web-based graphical user interface for easy file management.

## GUI Interface

DisktroByte now includes a modern web-based GUI that provides an intuitive interface for all operations:

### Starting the GUI

```bash
# Run the GUI directly
go run cmd/cli/main.go

# Or use the make command
make gui
```

The GUI will start a local web server (default port 8080) and automatically open in your browser. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### GUI Features

- **🔐 Password Management:** Secure password input for encryption/decryption
- **📦 File Chunking:** Drag-and-drop or browse to select files for chunking
- **🔧 File Reassembly:** Reassemble files from chunks with original filename
- **📤 File Upload:** Upload files to peers with progress tracking
- **🌐 Server Management:** Start and manage the P2P server
- **📊 Real-time Logs:** Live log output with timestamps
- **⚡ Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars for all operations
- **🎨 Modern UI:** Responsive design with beautiful gradients and animations

### GUI Workflow

1. **Set Password:** Enter your encryption password in the top section
2. **Choose Operation:** Use the tabbed interface to select your desired operation
3. **Configure Settings:** Fill in the required fields for your operation
4. **Execute:** Click the action button and monitor progress
5. **Monitor Logs:** Watch real-time logs in the bottom section

The GUI maintains all the security and functionality of the CLI while providing a user-friendly interface.

### File Explanations

-   `cmd/cli/main.go`: The main entry point for the command-line interface. It handles command parsing and orchestrates the application's workflow.
-   `internal/chunker/`: Contains the logic for splitting files into chunks and reassembling them.
-   `internal/compressor/`: Implements the compression logic, including the decision of whether to compress a file based on its type.
-   `internal/encryptor/`: Handles the encryption and decryption of file chunks.
-   `internal/storage/`: Defines the `Storage` interface and provides a `LocalStorage` implementation for storing chunks on the local filesystem.
-   `internal/metadata/`: Manages the metadata for files and chunks using a BadgerDB database.
-   `internal/transfer/`: Implements the client-server model for transferring files between peers.
-   `config/`: Contains the application's configuration files and the logic for loading them.

## Workflow

1.  **Chunking:** When a file is added to `DisktroByte`, it is first split into smaller chunks.
2.  **Compression:** Each chunk is then compressed, unless it's a file type that won't benefit from compression.
3.  **Encryption:** The compressed chunks are encrypted using ChaCha20-Poly1305.
4.  **Storage:** The encrypted chunks are stored using the configured storage backend (e.g., the local filesystem).
5.  **Metadata:** Metadata for the file and its chunks is stored in a BadgerDB database.
6.  **Transfer:** When a peer requests a file, the client initiates a transfer with the server, and the chunks are sent over the network.
7.  **Reassembly:** The receiving peer reassembles the file from the chunks, decrypts them, and decompresses them.

## Commands

### Build the Application

```bash
go build ./cmd/cli
```

### Run the Application

#### Start the Server

To start the `DisktroByte` server, run the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go server
```

The server will start on the port specified in the `config/config.yaml` file (default is `8080`).

#### Chunk a File

To split a file into chunks, use the `chunk` command:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go chunk <file_path>
```

This will create a series of chunk files in the `output_chunks` directory.

#### Upload a File

To upload a file to a peer, use the `upload` command:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go upload <file_path> <peer_address>
```

-   `<file_path>`: The path to the file you want to upload.
-   `<peer_address>`: The address of the peer you want to upload the file to (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

#### Reassemble a File

To reassemble a file from its chunks, use the `reassemble` command:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go reassemble <file_name> <output_path>
```

-   `<file_name>`: The name of the file as it was originally chunked.
-   `<output_path>`: The path where the reassembled file will be saved.
